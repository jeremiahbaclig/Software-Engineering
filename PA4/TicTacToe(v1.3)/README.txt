Project Strengths and Weaknesses

-Looking thoroughly through the project, nothing seems to be missing from the game.

-One of the project's strengths is its level of interaction with the player. The game features easy-to-follow
menus, making it a user-friendly experience. Another strength the project has is its game transitions, making it
convenient for players to start another game or return to the menu without many clicks in between. Over all, the
game's design and functionality makes it a solid tic tac toe application.

-One of the project's weaknesses is testing. While the game logic can easily be tested, the UI is particularly
difficult with the amount of UI elements within the game, which be easily missed and overlooked when testing
the application. Another weakness the project has is its advanced computer player. The advanced bot is sometimes
not able to predict or fully decide where to make a placement. However, this is only noticeable depending on
where the player places their piece on the grid.
